# Line-Detector

## Overview
The objective of this project was to design and develop an algorithm for line detection. 
An image of a tennis court was used as a test case where the aim is to detect the tennis court lines extract them and categorise them.

The following subsection will explain the pipeline of the algorithm step by step
